                    <p> With over 15 years of experience in engineering, both hands-on and in leadership roles, I've honed my skills across
                        diverse settings, including product companies, freelancing, and agencies.
                    </p>
                    <p>My track record includes leading successful strategic initiatives such as build system migrations, frontend transitions, and design system re-platforming.
                    Additionally, I've significantly impacted the wider engineering organization by co-creating career frameworks and
                    contributing to DEI initiatives in hiring and people management.</p>
