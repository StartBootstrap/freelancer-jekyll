After more than 4 years of supporting ResearchGate in making science more open my journey ended in a mass layoff. It's never pretty to be part of the group that has to leave but ultimately it's a chance to reevaluate your current life and consider the next step. And this is where we are now.

## About me

<hr class="star-primary">

With over 15 years of experience in engineering, both hands-on and in leadership roles, I've honed my skills across diverse settings, including product companies, freelancing, and agencies. My track record includes leading successful strategic initiatives such as build system migrations, frontend transitions, and design system re-platforming. Additionally, I've significantly impacted the wider engineering organization by co-creating career frameworks and contributing to DEI initiatives in hiring and people management.
<br><br>

## My leadership priorities

<hr class="star-primary">

### Psychological safety

Creating an environment in which people are encouraged and supported to speak up and contribute is a cornerstone for innovation and continous improvements, let alone a pure respectful and fair environment.

### Trust in individuals and teams

Reliance on the people who are closest to the problem to find the right solution reduces the risk of bottlenecks and a lack of innovation.

### Career development and a culture of feedback

In order to achieve high employee engagement, retention and organizational strength it's important to provide everyone with a clear growth path and the feedback to help them achieve their goals, at their pace.
