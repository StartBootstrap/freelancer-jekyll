## About me
<hr class="star-primary">

I'm a **manager and leader** with hands-on experience in a range of technologies and environments with teams of up to twelve professionals, regularly **including remote team members**. Most recently, I've joined ResearchGate, a professional network for scientists and researchers, **managing the Frontend Infrastructure Team**. <br>
Prior to that, I ran the German arm of a successful digital agency, managing the operational aspects of an office of 15 employees, handled the earliest stages of client relationship development, and **oversaw our local teams, projects and clients**.

I firmly believe in **robust processes** as the foundation of success for any organisation. **Caring for the team** & adherence to **strong values** can make this success last.

As an **Engineering Manager** I'm laser-focused on these three aspects of my team(s):
**PEOPLE, PROCESS & CULTURE**. 
Why I think these concerns are most relevant to my role I've laid out in [this article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/trinity-successful-engineering-teams-stefan-hoth/).

## About ResearchGate
<hr class="star-primary">

ResearchGate provides me with the environment I found I'm working at my best:

### Learning and personal growth are supported and encouraged
Internal knowledge transfer, community participation via meetups & conferences as well as "let's just try this different approach" are common practices.

### Career development and a culture of feedback
are understood as a means of high employee engagement & retention and organizational strength.

### Trust in individuals and teams
Reliance on the people who are closest to the problem to find the right solution reduces the risk of bottlenecks and a lack of innovation.
